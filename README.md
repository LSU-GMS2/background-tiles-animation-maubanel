# GMS2 Background, Tiles, Sprites & Animation

## Introduction
This tutorial is a brief look at various ways artwork can be used in GameMaker Studio 2.  We take a brief overview on formats.  We then look at how backgrounds and tiles work with some hands on examples.  We finish with the technique for animating a sprite and giving it simple 4 direction controls on a keyboard and gamepad. All the artwork that you need to complete the tutorial is included.

You will need to download and clone the [GitHub Classroom link GMS2-Tiles-and-Sprites](hhttps://classroom.github.com/a/8j3sK7Hd) for the assignment. This assignment is again focused on creating assets for a future top down RPG style game.  Please keep in mind that you will be turning this into a game in the next project.
